# **Email Communication Analysis: Insights into Organizational Dynamics**

Welcome to the Email Communication Analysis project! This repository showcases a detailed analysis of internal email communications within an organization, leveraging Power BI Desktop, Excel, and ZoomCharts. As part of the global DataDNA initiative by Onyx Data, the primary focus of this project is to unravel communication patterns, detect informal networks, and uncover sentiments expressed in the company's emails.

## **Project Description**

### **About the Project**
In today's fast-paced work environment, understanding how communication flows within an organization is crucial for enhancing collaboration and productivity. This project dives into the email communications of a company to gain insights into who is communicating with whom, the nature of these interactions, and the underlying sentiments. By analyzing these patterns, the organization can identify key influencers, detect potential bottlenecks, and foster a more connected work environment.

- **Work Behavior**: Examine whether emails are being sent outside of work hours or workdays, which may indicate work pressure or dedication.

### **Tools and Technologies Used**
- **Power BI Desktop**: Used for creating interactive dashboards that visualize communication patterns, network analysis, and sentiment trends.
- **Excel**: Utilized for data cleaning, transformation, and preliminary analysis.
- **ZoomCharts**: Integrated to provide advanced data visualizations and interactive features for exploring network connections and communication flow.


### **Dataset Structure**
